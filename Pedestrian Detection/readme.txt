This project detects, tracks and identifies unique pedestrians in a sequence of frames. 
The detection system counts the total number of pedestrians, the total number of groups and the destruction of groups as well.
Centroid based tracking of pedestrians is implemented using YOLO and group formation is detected using clustering.
